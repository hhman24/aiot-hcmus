I attempted to utilize a mobile app that assisted with performing physical activities without the use of equipment, but it quickly became boring and I gave up. why don't we do something fun and burn calories at the same time

## ‚õèÔ∏è How it work
When the user jumps, a system (Esp32+MPCU6050) is attached to the user's body or held by the user. User actions will be detected based on the accelerometer. EdgeImplulse analyzes the data from the accelerometer and decides whether the user will act normally or jump. If it's a Jump activity the system will simulate keystrokes send to the computer.
